# More ILLUSION
If you still not illuded, here is another potion of illusion for you. Can you survive it ?????

You can du it ........

Flag format :- enclose entire thing in shellctf{}

A - Thing you got after solving problem
B - Linux command (not entire command but specific one command that lead you to solution, ex- "cd .. ; ls -la" was command that showed me thing which lead me to flag then special command is "ls" and argument is "la")
Example flag -

Suppose I got string "H3re_1s_F1ag" from solving so my A = H3re_1s_F1ag
Some charaters are ommited complete the flag with all description above in below flag. ommited character corresponds to arguments of that you du.

After "H3re_1s_F1ag" one is special command rest are its arguments.

shellctf{H3re_1s_F1ag_xx_appaxxxx-xxxx_ah}
