Key points of challenge
- So we need to upload a pdf file which looks as if pdf with eyes but actually is not.
- And a statement inferno overwrite (actual move name is inferno overdrive) is my favourite move. Here over is hint for some overwrite character and hint 1 says about look from right to left.

Also making a file name with .pdf end which not actually ending in .pdf means we need something just to illude/change how it looks to user. Searching obfuscation techniques leads to rtlo which matches with description and hints.

Here comes the concept of right-to-left-overwrite character.

Combining above observation and making file with name as depicted below and uloading file with name like gives you the flag :- 
- shell.<right to left overide charater>fdp  ----> shell.â€®fdp 

  
  
Uploading file with name formulated as above

Hints with point values (cost) :-
- Hint 1 :- Everything is just related to **name and extension** of file not content in file ... (20 pts)
