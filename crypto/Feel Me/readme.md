# Feel me

The background Morse code if you identified was just a rabbit hole and don't have any meaning in it.

If you observe the video part there are some frames changing it might at first sight apears binary etc but nothing like that. If you look and have seen braille it somewhat like that.

Coverting video into gif.

And then split frames of gif with this link :- https://ezgif.com/split/ezgif-1-bd9972aeb3.gif

Making analogy 1 = dark dot and 0 = white dot hence we can derive a character from each frame.

All 0 = { and }

Example :-

This frame represents S

This frame represents H
