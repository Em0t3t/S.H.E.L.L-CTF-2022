Observation points
- As in ecryption we see 9 key length
- part of key is SHELL

Let's guess one more char and make key length 7 by adding { so current key becomes SHELL{

In Output we get (using solution.py)

We got a meaning full string "XORISC" still need more three characters to complete key .... Might it be "XORISCOOL" which actually becomes key

And we get the flag :-
SHELL{X0R_1S_R3VeR51BL3}
