# World's Greatest Detective.

It was a easy misc challenge where we were given a image and we had to decode it .

So some people thought that it was some kind of cipher,but if you have watched Marvel's Black Panther you may know that it's not really a cipher but a wakandian language .

so we just need to translate this to english to get the flag, i used this image to translate the symbols .

so by this we get the flag : ```SHELLCTF{W4kandA_F0rev3r}```

```RIP T'Challa/Chadwick Boseman```.
